        The Bellingham Table Tennis Club is a club of dedicated table tennis (ping pong) players from Whatcom and Skagit Counties in Washington State. Several times every week our diverse group of intermediate and advanced players play at a private facility. We practice informal skill-building drills and play competitive matches.
